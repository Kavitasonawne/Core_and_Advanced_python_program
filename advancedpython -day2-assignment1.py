#You have a list of employee records, and you need to create a new list that contains the names of employees who work in the 'Sales' department, all in uppercase. Example Data:

#employees = [ {"name": "John Doe", "department": "Sales"}, {"name": "Jane Smith", "department": "Marketing"}, {"name": "Emily Johnson", "department": "Sales"}, {"name": "Michael Brown", "department": "HR"} ]

employees = [
    {"name": "John Doe", "department": "Sales"},
    {"name": "Jane Smith", "department": "Marketing"},
    {"name": "Emily Johnson", "department": "Sales"},
    {"name": "Michael Brown", "department": "HR"}
]

# Using list comprehension to filter and uppercase the names
sales_employees = [employee['name'].upper() for employee in employees if employee['department'] == 'Sales']


print(sales_employees)
#output
['JOHN DOE', 'EMILY JOHNSON']
